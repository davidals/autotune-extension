# Model Selection and Enhancement Tuning Feature

## Overview
This feature allows users to select the AI model for text enhancement and fine-tune the enhancement parameters to achieve their desired writing style.

## Model Selection
- Users can select from available OpenAI models:
  - GPT-3.5 Turbo
  - GPT-4
  - GPT-4 Turbo
- The selected model persists across sessions
- Model selection affects the quality and capabilities of the enhancement

## Enhancement Tuning
Users can adjust several parameters to control how their text is enhanced:

### Tuning Parameters
1. **Verbosity**
   - Controls the level of detail and length of the enhanced text
   - Range: 0-100
   - 0: Very concise, minimal wording
   - 100: Very detailed, elaborate explanations

2. **Formality**
   - Controls the level of formality in the language
   - Range: 0-100
   - 0: Very casual, conversational style
   - 100: Very formal, professional language

3. **Tone**
   - Controls the emotional tone of the text
   - Range: 0-100
   - 0: Very serious, straightforward
   - 100: Very friendly, warm

4. **Creativity**
   - Controls how creative or conservative the enhancement is
   - Range: 0-100
   - 0: Conservative, factual
   - 100: Creative, imaginative

5. **Persuasiveness**
   - Controls how persuasive the text should be
   - Range: 0-100
   - 0: Neutral, objective
   - 100: Very persuasive, convincing

### Technical Requirements
1. Parameter Storage
   - All parameters should be stored in Chrome's sync storage
   - Parameters should persist across sessions
   - Default values should be set at 50 (neutral) for all parameters

2. Parameter Validation
   - All values must be integers between 0 and 100
   - Invalid values should be clamped to the valid range
   - NaN or undefined values should default to 50

3. API Integration
   - Parameters should be included in the enhancement request to the OpenAI API
   - The API prompt should be adjusted based on these parameters

### User Interface Requirements
1. Slider Controls
   - Each parameter should have a slider input
   - Sliders should show current value
   - Sliders should be responsive and update in real-time

2. Visual Feedback
   - Current values should be clearly displayed
   - Changes should be saved automatically
   - Loading states should be indicated while saving

### Error Handling
1. Storage Errors
   - Failed parameter saves should be reported to the user
   - Default values should be used if loading fails

2. Validation Errors
   - Invalid input should be prevented
   - Users should be notified of invalid input attempts

## Success Criteria
1. Users can successfully adjust all enhancement parameters
2. Parameters persist across sessions
3. Enhancement results reflect the chosen parameters
4. All parameters are properly validated and sanitized
5. Error states are properly handled and communicated
6. UI is responsive and provides clear feedback
